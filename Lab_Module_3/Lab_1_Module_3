The development of self-driving cars is one of the most trendy and popular directions in the world of AI and machine learning.
In 2020, we saw advancements from companies like Waymo that allow customers to hail self-driving taxis, a service called Waymo One
Alibabaâ€™s AutoX launched a fleet of fully automated cars in Shenzhen that have no accompanying safety drivers.
Automotive Artificial Intelligence is rapidly displacing human drivers by enabling self-driving cars that use sensors to gather data about their surroundings. 
But how do self-driving cars interpret that data? This is the biggest use case of machine learning in automotive.
